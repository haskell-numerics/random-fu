-- is a triangle ramping up from a lower bound to a specified midpoint
-- and back down to the upper bound.  This is a very simple distribution
-- that does not generally occur naturally but is used sometimes as an
-- estimate of a true distribution when only the range of the values and
-- an approximate mode of the true distribution are known.
