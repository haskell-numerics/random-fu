Random-fu
=========

Random-number generation based on modeling random variables as first-class entities.  This library currently consists of 3 major parts:

rvar
----

This package defines the central datatype of the system, a monad transformer called `RVarT` which extends an arbitrary monad with non-backtracking nondeterminism.  In particular, the `RVar` type (an alias for `RVar Identity`) models pure random variables.

random-source
-------------

This package provides the backend for `RVarT`; arbitrary sources of entropy.  Its design is still in major flux.

random-fu
---------

This package provides an end-user interface that defines random variables following several standard distributions as well as some convenient interfaces for sampling them.

Usage
=====

To use the system, you'll typically want import at least two modules: `Data.Random` for the main interface and a supported entropy source, such as `System.Random.MWC` from the `mwc-random` package.  You may also want to import one or more of the extra distributions provided in the `Data.Random.Distribution` heirarchy (uniform and normal are exported by `Data.Random` automatically).  Then, you can define random variables using `do` notation, sample them using `sampleFrom`, etc.  For example:

    import Data.Random
    import System.Random.MWC (create)

    logNormal :: Double -> Double -> RVar Double
    logNormal mu sigmaSq = do
        x <- normal mu sigmaSq
        return (exp x)

    main = do
        mwc <- create
        y <- sampleFrom mwc (logNormal 5 1)
        print y

Developers
==========

Ensure that you run the benchmarks before making a PR e.g. `stack bench` and then run the resulting binary.
