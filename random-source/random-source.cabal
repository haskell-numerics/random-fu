synopsis:               Generic basis for random number generators
description:            Random number generation based on entropy sources
                        able to produce a small but well-defined set of
                        primitive variates.  Also includes facilities for
                        \"completing\" partial implementations, making it
                        easy to define new entropy sources in a way that
                        is naturally forward-compatible.
                        .
                        Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5.  The people responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.
                        .
                        Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some external ones too.  Whoops.  Please don't use this version, it will only end in tears.
                        .
                        Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building
                        with MTL-1
                        .
                        Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC's deprecation
                        of Foreign.unsafePerformIO
                        .
                        Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*'s crazy
                        Template Haskell changes.
