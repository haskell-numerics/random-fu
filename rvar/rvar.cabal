synopsis:               Random Variables
description:            Random number generation based on modeling random 
                        variables by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
                        composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
                        either monadic or \"pure\" styles.
                        .
                        The primary purpose of this library is to support 
                        defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
                        random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
                        but performance is an important goal too.
                        .
                        In my testing, I have found it capable of speed 
                        comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
                        a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of 
                        the same algorithms.
