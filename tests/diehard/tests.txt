     ::            This is the BIRTHDAY SPACINGS TEST                 ::
     :: Choose m birthdays in a year of n days.  List the spacings    ::
     :: between the birthdays.  If j is the number of values that     ::
     :: occur more than once in that list, then j is asymptotically   ::
     :: Poisson distributed with mean m^3/(4n).  Experience shows n   ::
     :: must be quite large, say n>=2^18, for comparing the results   ::
     :: to the Poisson distribution with that mean.  This test uses   ::
     :: n=2^24 and m=2^9,  so that the underlying distribution for j  ::
     :: is taken to be Poisson with lambda=2^27/(2^26)=2.  A sample   ::
     :: of 500 j's is taken, and a chi-square goodness of fit test    ::
     :: provides a p value.  The first test uses bits 1-24 (counting  ::
     :: from the left) from integers in the specified file.           ::
     ::   Then the file is closed and reopened. Next, bits 2-25 are   ::
     :: used to provide birthdays, then 3-26 and so on to bits 9-32.  ::
     :: Each set of bits provides a p-value, and the nine p-values    ::
     :: provide a sample for a KSTEST.                                ::

     :: derings of five numbers.  Thus the 5th, 6th, 7th,...numbers   ::
     :: each provide a state. As many thousands of state transitions  ::
     :: are observed,  cumulative counts are made of the number of    ::
     :: occurences of each state.  Then the quadratic form in the     ::
     :: weak inverse of the 120x120 covariance matrix yields a test   ::
     :: equivalent to the likelihood ratio test that the 120 cell     ::
     :: counts came from the specified (asymptotically) normal dis-   ::

       NOTE: Most of the tests in DIEHARD return a p-value, which
       should be uniform on [0,1) if the input file contains truly
       independent random bits.   Those p-values are obtained by
       p=F(X), where F is the assumed distribution of the sample
       random variable X---often normal. But that assumed F is just
       an asymptotic approximation, for which the fit will be worst
       in the tails. Thus you should not be surprised with
       occasional p-values near 0 or 1, such as .0012 or .9983.
       When a bit stream really FAILS BIG, you will get p's of 0 or
       1 to six or more places.  By all means, do not, as a
       Statistician might, think that a p < .025 or p> .975 means
       that the RNG has "failed the test at the .05 level".  Such
       p's happen among the hundreds that DIEHARD produces, even
       with good RNG's.  So keep in mind that " p happens".
